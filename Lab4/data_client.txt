Hello,The Foundation's children's literacy website originated in 1999 as Storyline--a toll-free telephone line where children could call in and hear stories read by well-known actors. Established in June 2002, Storyline Online is an interactive website featuring videos of celebrated actors reading children's books alongside creatively produced motion graphics which include visual effects such as camera pans, movement, sound effects and music. Illustrations are respected and not substantially changed. Each video features a celebrated reader such as Viola Davis, Chris Pine, Kevin Costner, Annette Bening, James Earl Jones, Elijah Wood, Betty White, Allison Janney, Rita Moreno, Christian Slater and more! These professional storytellers help to inspire a love of reading in children worldwide
